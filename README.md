### Project description

It's a portfolio of out team(4 people) who created this webpage during the **two-day hackathon**. During those 2 days we created a lot of functionality: authorization, team representation, ability to join our team, resume creator and more. As a result our team took ðŸ¥‡ place. And this place really shows how much work we were able to accomplish in such a short period of time.

### Development description

We used **React** and **Redux** to create the whole project. We also used **Firebase** for Authorization, Realtime Database and Images Storage. For styling we tried **Material UI**.
